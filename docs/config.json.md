### prefix
As you may be well aware (from other bots), commands start with a prefix.
A common prefix is `!`.
The `prefix` value allows you to specify the prefix of the bot.
This is a `STRING` data type.
Your prefix can be any number of characters long, however you may want to be careful doing a mention prefix (`<@!USERID>`).
STIADSðŸ‘€ Bot currently does not support multiple prefixes.

### token
Every bot requires a token to login and go online.
<span title="unless you really want to risk ruining everything...">You should **NEVER** give your bot token to anyone.</span><br>
To find your token:
1. Navigate to [The Discord Applications Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click on your bot app
3. Go to the Bot tab
4. Where it says Token, click on the button that says "Copy" to copy and paste it into the `config.json` file
	- You can regenerate a token here as well, if someone else gets ahold of it.

This is a `STRING` data type.
<span title="dont try. it would be way less secure if you were the one to choose the token">You cannot customize your token.</span>

### welcomechannel
When a member joins, STIADSðŸ‘€ Bot will send a message to welcome them.
Copy & Paste the ID of the channel you want to welcome members in.

Settings.
This is a `STRING` data type, be sure to encase in quotations.

This is an array of Integers with which, when the user reaches one of them, assigns them a corresponding role.
