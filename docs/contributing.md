# Contributing
Contributions are welcome, and they're fairly simple, however it is beyond the scope of a README file to explain in detail. In general however, look up information as needed:

- Fork the Repository
- Clone the Fork
- Make Changes & Commit
- Write Proper Commit Messages!
- Create a Pull Request to merge with the main branch
- Make it Detailed!
